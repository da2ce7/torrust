Torrust Index Meta-Repository
=============================

This is the meta-repository for the Torrust Index project, which consists of two separate repositories:

-   [Torrust Index Backend](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index-backend): A Rust backend that serves as an index for torrent files.
-   [Torrust Index Frontend](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index-frontend): A Vue frontend that connects to the backend and provides a user interface for searching and browsing torrent files.

This meta-repository provides an overview of the Torrust Index project and explains the relationship between the backend and frontend repositories.

About Torrust Index
-------------------

Torrust Index is a project that aims to provide a simple and efficient way to search for and browse torrent files. The project consists of two main components: the backend and the frontend.

The backend is built with Rust and provides a REST API for querying a database of torrent files. It uses the `actix-web` framework for handling HTTP requests and `diesel` for interacting with the database.

The frontend is built with Vue.js and provides a modern and responsive user interface for searching and browsing the index. It uses `axios` for making HTTP requests to the backend and `vue-router` for handling navigation between pages.

Repository Structure
--------------------

This meta-repository does not contain any code, but serves as a central point for accessing the two main repositories that make up the Torrust Index project.

The [Torrust Index Backend](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index-backend) repository contains the source code for the backend. It includes a `README.md` file with instructions for building and running the backend.

The [Torrust Index Frontend](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index-frontend) repository contains the source code for the frontend. It includes a `README.md` file with instructions for building and running the frontend.
